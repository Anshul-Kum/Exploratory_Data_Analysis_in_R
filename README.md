This project delves into the relationship between diverse customer variables and their total spending (MntTotal) over the past two years. We analyze how features like age, income, and household composition influence MntTotal and utilize machine learning to predict future spending.

**Key findings**:

- Significant correlations: MntTotal exhibits strong correlations with variables such as Income, Age, Kidhome, and Teenhome.
- Predictive model: A linear regression model trained on these variables achieves an R-squared value of 0.7367, indicating that 73.67% of the variance in MntTotal can be explained by the chosen features.
- Mean square error (MSE): The model's MSE is 104581.9, suggesting a reasonable prediction accuracy.

**Future exploration potential**:

- Binary variables: Examining the impact of binary variables like marital status (Divorced, Married) on MntTotal.
- Education and income: Analyzing the influence of educational background on income and ultimately, MntTotal.
- Additional variables: Investigating other significant features like spending on specific categories (MntWines, MntFruits) for deeper insights.
- Alternative models: Exploring the performance of different machine learning algorithms and comparing them to the current linear regression model.

This project provides a valuable foundation for understanding customer behavior and predicting spending patterns, paving the way for further research and development.
